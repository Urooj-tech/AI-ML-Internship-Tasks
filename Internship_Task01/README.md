#  AI/ML Internship Tasks Repository

Hello Again! This repo contains my work on various tasks assigned during the internship, starting with exploratory data analysis of the Iris dataset.

##  Task 1: Exploring and Visualizing a Simple Dataset

###  Objective
To load, inspect, and visualize the **Iris dataset** in order to understand its structure, feature relationships, value distributions, and outliers.

###  Dataset Used
- **Name**: Iris Dataset
- **Source**: Built-in dataset from Seaborn
- **Features**:
  - sepal_length
  - sepal_width
  - petal_length
  - petal_width
  - species (target class with 3 categories)

###  Methods Applied
- **Data Loading & Inspection**:
  - Used `pandas` for exploring dataset shape, column types, and summary statistics
- **Visualizations**:
  - `seaborn.pairplot` to visualize feature relationships by class
  - Histograms for value distributions of each feature
  - Boxplots to identify potential outliers and feature spread

###  Key Findings
- Dataset is clean, no missing values.
- Petal length and petal width provide clear separation between species.
- Sepal dimensions are more overlapping.
- Petal width shows higher variance and is a strong discriminator between classes.
